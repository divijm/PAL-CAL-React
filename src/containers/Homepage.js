                  <p>PAL/PASS sessions are designed to deepen your understanding of the unit content while acquiring transferable study skills. In these sessions, you will develop study techniques, improve communication skills and group interaction skills.</p>

                  <p>PAL/PASS leaders structure the sessions to ensure a collaborative learning environment. The PAL/PASS leaderâ€™s role is not to teach or provide you with the answers, but to enable you to develop the skills to find the answers yourself.</p>
